# NodeJS International Export Integration Software

🚀 Project Overview 🌟

This software solution was developed to help individuals overcome the challenges brought on by increasing dollar prices and inflation in our country. It allows users to sell products internationally and earn revenue by leveraging e-commerce platforms in other countries. The system integrates with the Trendyol API to automatically fetch single or bulk products and, through automated English translation, uploads them to foreign e-commerce platforms like Ozon and AliExpress using their APIs. 🌍💼

💡 Stockless E-Commerce: This Node.js project, built on MongoDB, enables stockless e-commerce by automating the process of product management. The system ensures that if the price or stock of products listed on Trendyol changes, it will automatically track these changes using cron jobs, updating prices and stock every 12 or 24 hours. 📦🔄

📈 Proven Success: Since its launch, the project has reached over 150+ users on the Ozon platform and generated over 750,000 TRY in revenue, proving its effectiveness and profitability in the international market. 💵📊

💳 Subscription-Based Model: The application operates on a subscription-based model, with users able to purchase monthly, six-month, or yearly memberships. Once subscribed, users can access the API to pull products from Trendyol and upload them to various international e-commerce platforms, creating new business opportunities and revenue streams. 🔑💻

🚀 Global E-Commerce Integration: This solution empowers individuals to enter the international market with ease, facilitating the automation of product listings, stock updates, and price management, allowing businesses to focus on growth without the hassle of manual updates. 🌐✨
